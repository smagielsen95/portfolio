		<H2>Healthy oceans are the life support system for our planet, providing 97 percent of the Earth’s livable habitat and a home to more than 700,000 species. The oceans are vital to human health as well, providing jobs, enjoyment and food to billions of people. Half of the oxygen we breathe is generated by our oceans.</H2>
		<p>Our oceans are in more trouble than ever before.
Right now it is estimated that up to 12 million metric tons of plastic – everything from plastic bottles and bags to microbeads – ends up in our oceans each year. That’s a truckload of trash every minute.
Traveling on ocean currents, this plastic is now turning up in every corner of our planet – from Florida beaches to uninhabited Pacific islands. It is even being found trapped in Arctic ice.
Our oceans are slowly turning into a plastic soup, and the effects on ocean life are chilling.  Discarded plastic fishing lines trap and entangle turtles and seabirds, and plastic pieces of all sizes choke and clog the stomachs of creatures who mistake it for food, from tiny zooplankton to whales. Plastic is now entering every level of the ocean food chain and is even ending up in the seafood on our plates.</p>

<p>Overfishing is threatening food security for hundreds of millions of people and destroying ocean ecosystems worldwide. We’ve already removed at least two-thirds of the large fish in the ocean, and one in three fish populations have collapsed since 1950. Put simply, there are too many boats chasing too few fish.</p></div>
						<div class="col-3"><H2>Commercial Whaling</H2>
<p>It’s hard to believe commercial whaling still happens, isn’t it? The practice was rampant for so long that many whale species may never recover. In the US, the North Atlantic right whale is down to about 350 remaining individuals. The blue whales of the Antarctic are at less than 1 percent of their original population. West Pacific grey whale populations are the most endangered of the world’s great whales, hovering on the edge of extinction with only slightly more than 100 remaining.</p></div>
			<div class="col-3"><H2>Pollution & Climate Change</H2>
<p>Oil spills and other pollution at sea—while they carry serious consequences—actually account for a small fraction of ocean pollution. Nearly half of all ocean pollution comes from activities that take place on land, like sewage, industrial and agricultural runoff, garbage dumping, and chemical spills.</p></div>
			<div class="col-3"><H2>Human Rights on Land & At Sea</H2>
<p>Changing the way we treat our oceans isn’t just about the creatures that live in them, it’s about the people that depend on them. Globally, more than three billion people depend on our oceans and coastal ecosystems for their livelihood.</p></div>
